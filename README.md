# File rename script

Operating Systems (OS) allow to create very powerful **automation proccesses**. However, in order NOT to be OS-dependant when creating smaller automation proccesses, it makes sense to develop these in a programming language other thatn the OS's.

The following script **uses Python** to:

- Update Computer Assisted Translation generated target file names
- Update "lang" and "xml:lang" attributes inside HTML files

Although this can br quickly achieved using the Operaing Systems commands, instead of having to create specific scripts for each operating System, we can create **a unique script in Python** and have it **exported** into as many Operaing Systems **executable file types** as required.

1. Folder "Directory-Target-Files": contains the files as produced by CAT tool
2. Folder "Finished_target_files": contains the **renamed files** after executing the script
