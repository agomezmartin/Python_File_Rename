# File rename script

Operating Systems (OS) allow to create very powerful **automation proccesses**. However, in order NOT to be OS-dependant when creating smaller automation processes, developing these in a programming language other than the OS's might help create more scalable scripts.

On that note, programming languages tend to have more powerful tools to **write into files**.

The following script **uses Python** to:

- Update target **file names** generated by a Computer Assisted Tool
- Update "lang" and "xml:lang" **HTML attributes** to match each **target language**

Although renaming files can be quickly achieved using the Operaing Systems commands, **a unique Python script** can be created and **exported** into as many Operaing Systems **executable file types** as required.
