# File rename script

Operating Systems (OS) allow to create very powerful **automation proccesses**. However, in order NOT to be OS-dependant when creating smaller automation proccesses, it makes sense to develop these in a programming language other thatn the OS's.
This entry illustrates **how to uso Python**:

- Update Computer Assisted Translation generated target files names
- Update "lang" and "xml:lang" attributes inside HTML files

Although this is quicly achieved through the Operaing Systems commands, instead of having to create specific scripts for each operating System, we can create **a unique script** in Python and have it **exported** into as many Operaing Systems executable types as required.
