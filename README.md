# File rename script

Operating Systems (OS) allow to create very powerful **automation proccesses**. However, in order NOT to be OS-dependant when creating smaller automation proccesses, developing these processes in a programming language other thatn the OS's might help make theese procceses more scalable.

The following script **uses Python** to:

- Update target **file names** generated by a Computer Assisted Tool
- Update "lang" and "xml:lang" **attributes** inside HTML files to match each **target language**

Although this can be quickly achieved using the Operaing Systems commands, **a unique Python script** can be created and **exported** into as many Operaing Systems **executable file types** as required.

1. Folder "Directory-Target-Files": contains the files as produced by CAT tool
2. Folder "Finished_target_files": contains the **renamed files** after executing the script
